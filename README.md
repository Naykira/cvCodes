Bunch of Computer Vision codes that I have made for tutorial purpose. Help yourself out, find and take whatever you need. Also adding few images which I feel might help demonstrate the usage.

Functions are based on OpenCV(C++ and Python), SimpleCV. Some algorithms have been implemented by me and/or Siddharth.
